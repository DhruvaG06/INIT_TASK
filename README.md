**Reflection Summary:**  
The paper introduced AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network that transformed computer vision by achieving record-breaking accuracy on ImageNet. My reflection explored its limitation of high computational cost and the need for large labeled datasets.  

To address this, I implemented **EcoNet**, a lightweight CNN inspired by AlexNet that focuses on energy efficiency and model compression. EcoNet demonstrates that strong performance can be achieved with fewer parameters and lower computation, pointing toward a future of sustainable deep learning.
